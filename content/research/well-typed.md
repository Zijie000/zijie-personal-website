## Overview
> I am doing this project 🐪 to put into practice the knowledge from *Types and Programming Languages* by Benjamin C. Pierce, mainly to demonstrate my understanding of the concepts presented in the book.

Use OCaml 🐪 as Parser/AST: to represent the program, Typechecker: to check whether the type is correct, Evaluator: to execute step by step according to the operational semantics, Error Cases: to find the error program.📝

## Current Work
✅ A collection of small, well-scoped language implementations with parsing, type checking, and evaluation:
    - STLC (Simply Typed Lambda Calculus)
    - System F (polymorphic lambda calculus)
    - F<: (System F with subtyping)
    - Refs (simply typed lambda calculus with references)

✅ Each language includes:
    - Parser/AST: parse strings to AST and pretty-print
    - Typechecker: static semantics with helpful error messages
    - Evaluator: small-step operational behavior via an interpreter
    - Tests: positive/negative programs to validate behavior
